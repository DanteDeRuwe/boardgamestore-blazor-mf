# BoardgameStore: Microfrontends & Blazor!

A proof-of-concept e-commerce application for showing the capabilities of the microfrontend architecture within Blazor.
It is using a ".NET all the way" approach. 

This is used in my talk about microfrontends with Blazor. 

It is also a fork of the code used for my bachelor thesis *"Enabling the distributed development of Blazor based web applications using a Microfrontend architecture"* which can be read [here](https://thesis.deruwe.me).


This code consists roughly of 3 parts
1. appshell
2. microfrontends
   - order
   - discover
3. microfrontend framework


## Overview of the architecture
